    <h3>Scientific Vision</h3>
    <p>
      My research focuses on the intersection of <strong>formal reasoning</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>,
      aiming to develop <strong>neurosymbolic systems</strong> that can reason, adapt, and explain their behavior.
      I study how temporal and strategic logics can serve as the foundation for transparent AI in
      <em>interactive, educational, and humanâ€“machine environments</em>.

    <h3>Collaborations and Open Directions</h3>
    <p>
      I collaborate with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/astrea-naples/home?authuser=0">Astrea Lab</a>
      on formal logic and multi-agent reasoning, and with interdisciplinary groups in healthcare and education.
      Future work aims to connect <strong>strategic reasoning</strong> with <strong>interactive learning environments</strong>,
      fostering transparent AI systems grounded in logic and simulation.
