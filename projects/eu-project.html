    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>INFANT</strong> is part of Italy‚Äôs National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) within the MUSA initiative.  
      The project aims to create an <strong>intelligent and adaptive framework</strong> to support the regional pediatric oncology network in Campania.  
      It integrates <strong>AI-driven reasoning</strong>, <strong>data analytics</strong>, and <strong>digital infrastructures</strong> to connect research, clinical centers, and decision-making tools for more transparent and effective healthcare processes.
    </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop <strong>AI reasoning models</strong> to assist clinical and organizational decisions in pediatric oncology.</li>
      <li>Promote the use of <strong>formal logic and neurosymbolic AI</strong> to make healthcare systems more explainable and trustworthy.</li>
      <li>Design <strong>digital tools</strong> for knowledge sharing and interoperability across hospitals and research centers.</li>
      <li>Foster <strong>cross-disciplinary collaboration</strong> between AI researchers, clinicians, and data scientists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My Role in INFANT</h3>
    <p>
      As a researcher at the <strong>University of Naples Federico II</strong>, I contribute to the research activities of the project,  
      focusing on <strong>reasoning and knowledge representation</strong> within intelligent healthcare systems.  
      My work involves exploring <em>temporal and strategic logics</em> (ATL/CTL) for modeling decision processes and investigating 
      <strong>neurosymbolic approaches</strong> that combine formal reasoning with machine learning techniques.  
      Rather than development tasks, my contribution is mainly theoretical ‚Äî designing, analyzing, and validating models 
      that can explain and predict behaviors in complex clinical environments.
