  <h2 class="section-title"><span class="title-text">INFANT: A European Project for Pediatric Oncology Network</span></h2>

  <p><strong>Programme:</strong> Horizon Europe â€¢ <strong>Grant Agreement:</strong> No. 101012394 â€¢ <strong>Period:</strong> 2024â€“2027</p>
  <p><strong>Role:</strong> PhD Researcher â€“ Work Package 3: Intelligent Systems for Clinical Decision Support</p>

  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The INFANT project aims to create a cutting-edge pediatric oncology network across Campania, Italy, combining 
    advanced <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, <strong>data analytics</strong>, and <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong> technologies.  
    The initiative focuses on improving diagnostic processes, treatment personalization, and patient monitoring by leveraging AI-powered decision support systems and real-time data from various healthcare devices.
  </p>

  <h3>Objectives</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Develop AI-driven systems</strong> to enhance clinical decision-making in pediatric oncology.</li>
    <li><strong>Create digital twins</strong> of pediatric cancer patients to simulate treatment pathways and outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Build an interoperable data platform</strong> for collecting and analyzing real-time health data, enabling personalized treatment.</li>
    <li><strong>Design user-friendly interfaces</strong> for clinicians, researchers, and caregivers to easily interpret the results and adapt care plans.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My Role in INFANT</h3>
  <p>
    As a PhD researcher in Work Package 3, my role focuses on designing and implementing intelligent systems that can model and analyze complex medical data. 
    Specifically, I work on developing <strong>cognitive reasoning modules</strong> using <em>temporal logics (ATL/CTL)</em> to support clinical decision-making, as well as creating <strong>interactive simulations</strong> for personalized treatment modeling.  
    My contributions also involve integrating real-time patient data with AI models, ensuring that the systems are both clinically relevant and user-friendly.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Outcomes and Deliverables</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Design of an interactive clinical decision-support system based on <strong>temporal logics</strong> and patient data models.</li>
    <li>Development of a <strong>digital twin</strong> framework for simulating pediatric oncology treatment pathways.</li>
    <li>Creation of a data platform to support collaboration across the INFANT network, enabling seamless integration of research and clinical workflows.</li>
    <li>Contribution to several peer-reviewed papers and project deliverables, including the systemâ€™s design documents and user interface guidelines.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Consortium Partners</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>University of Naples Federico II</strong> (Lead Partner)</li>
    <li><strong>Hospital Santobono-Pausilipon</strong> (Clinical Partner)</li>
    <li><strong>Italian Institute of Technology</strong> (Research Partner)</li>
    <li><strong>SoftWave</strong> (Technology Partner)</li>
    <li><strong>University of Salerno</strong> (Academic Partner)</li>
  </ul>
