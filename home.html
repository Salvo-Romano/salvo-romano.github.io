    <h3>News & Updates</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>October 2025</strong> â€” I will be attending <strong>ECAI 2025</strong> in Bologna, Italy, serving as a <em>Student Volunteer</em> throughout the entire conference, including the two days of workshops.  
      Iâ€™m looking forward to contributing to the eventâ€™s organization and engaging with the European AI research community.</li>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a researcher working on the frontier between <strong>symbolic reasoning</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>, 
        studying how <em>logic-based AI</em> and <em>simulation</em> can enhance 
        human understanding and decision-making.  
        My work often bridges <strong>AI theory and interactive systems</strong>, 
        from digital twins for sustainable environments to cognitive models in educational contexts.

      <h3>Highlights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Researcher within the European project <strong>INFANT</strong>, dedicated to developing an <em>AI-driven pediatric oncology network</em> in Campania.</li>
        <li>Active member of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/astrea-naples/home?authuser=0">Astrea Lab</a>, focusing on <em>AI reasoning and formal verification</em>.</li>
        <li>Participation at <strong>AAMAS</strong> and other international venues, contributing to discussions on <em>multi-agent systems</em> and <em>neurosymbolic AI</em>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
        My research interests include <strong>neurosymbolic models</strong>, <strong>temporal and strategic logics (ATL/CTL)</strong>, 
        <strong>digital twins</strong>, and <strong>interactive AI environments</strong>.  
        Iâ€™m particularly fascinated by how formal reasoning can make AI systems more explainable and trustworthy.

    <h3>Vision</h3>
    <p>
      I believe that artificial intelligence should not only optimize systems but also 
      help people understand them.  
      My long-term goal is to develop <strong>transparent, interpretable AI frameworks</strong> that merge 
      formal logic with data-driven learning â€” enabling machines to reason, explain, and adapt
      within the complexity of real-world contexts.
