    <h2>Building Smarter, More Understandable AI</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m working at the intersection of <strong>reasoning</strong>, <strong>simulation</strong>, and 
      <strong>human-AI collaboration</strong> - exploring how machines can learn to make sense of the world 
      while staying clear and trustworthy to humans.
      My research blends <em>formal logic</em> with <em>machine learning</em> to create systems that can not only 
      make decisions but also explain why they make them.  
      Recently, Iâ€™ve been developing an <strong>AI for videogames</strong> that uses 
      <em>temporal logic</em> to handle time, goals, and strategy, giving virtual agents a smarter, 
      more human-like way to reason about complex scenarios.

        <strong>October 2025</strong> - Iâ€™ll be at <strong>ECAI 2025</strong> in Bologna (Italy) as a 
        <em>Student Volunteer</em>, helping during the workshops and main sessions.  
        Excited to meet new people and contribute to one of Europeâ€™s leading AI conferences.

      <h3>What I Work On</h3>
      <p>
        I study how <strong>logic-based reasoning</strong> and <strong>simulation</strong> can improve 
        how AI understands and interacts with people.  
        My work ranges from <strong>digital twins</strong> for sustainable systems to <strong>neurosymbolic models</strong> 
        that combine structured reasoning with adaptive learning.  
        Iâ€™m especially interested in how these methods can make AI both smarter and easier to trust.

      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
        My research interests revolve around <strong>temporal and strategic logics (ATL/CTL)</strong>, 
        <strong>neurosymbolic AI</strong>, <strong>digital twins</strong>, and <strong>interactive agents</strong>.  
        Iâ€™m drawn to the challenge of blending precise reasoning with creative adaptability, making AI
        that feels more like a thoughtful partner than a black box.

      <h3>Beyond the Lab</h3>
      <p>
        Outside of research, I love experimenting with new ways to make AI accessible, through 
        <strong>games</strong>, <strong>interactive demos</strong>, and <strong>open-source tools</strong>.  
        I see videogames as a great testing ground for logical AI: theyâ€™re dynamic, unpredictable, and 
        full of real-time decisions, the perfect place to see how intelligent reasoning holds up under pressure.

    <h3>Vision</h3>
    <p>
      I believe AI should do more than optimize processes, it should help people understand them.  
      My goal is to build <strong>transparent, interpretable AI frameworks</strong> that can reason, 
      adapt, and collaborate across real-world settings, from healthcare to interactive media.
