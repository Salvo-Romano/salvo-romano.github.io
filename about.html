    <h3>Academic Profile</h3>
    <p>
      I am a PhD student within the <strong>National PhD in Artificial Intelligence ‚Äì Agrifood and Environment</strong> program at the 
      <strong>University of Naples Federico II</strong>. My research explores the intersection of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, 
      <strong>formal methods</strong>, and <strong>digital twin technologies</strong>, aiming to create intelligent models capable of 
      understanding and optimizing complex real-world systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      My academic background in <em>computer engineering</em> and <em>logic-based AI</em> provides a solid foundation for studying 
      how reasoning, simulation, and interaction converge in autonomous decision-making systems.

    <h3>Current Research</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently contributing to the European project <strong>INFANT</strong>, which aims to develop intelligent and adaptive frameworks 
      for pediatric healthcare and education. My work focuses on the <strong>design of interactive simulations</strong> and 
      <strong>reasoning modules</strong> that model adaptive behavior and social interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within INFANT, I collaborate with interdisciplinary teams to integrate <em>symbolic reasoning</em> and 
      <em>machine learning</em> into AI systems that can interact meaningfully with users and provide interpretable outcomes. 
      This approach bridges rigorous formal logic with human-centered design.

  <!-- Broader Perspective -->
  <section class="card soft">
    <h3>Beyond Research</h3>
    <p>
      Beyond my doctoral work, I am passionate about science communication, open-source collaboration, and the ethical implications of 
      emerging technologies. I believe that academic research should not only advance theory, but also inspire 
      <strong>responsible innovation</strong> and foster <strong>dialogue between technology and society</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I regularly participate in conferences such as <strong>AAMAS</strong> and workshops focused on <em>multi-agent systems</em>, 
      <em>human‚ÄìAI interaction</em>, and <em>formal reasoning</em>, which continually shape my perspective on the future of intelligent systems.
