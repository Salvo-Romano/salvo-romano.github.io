  <p class="section-sub">A quick look at my background, research path, and what drives my work in AI.</p>

  <!-- Academic Overview -->
  <section class="card alt">
    <h3>Academic Profile</h3>
    <p>
      My path into AI started from a simple question: how do systems decide, and how can we make those decisions understandable?
      Over time, this grew into a research vision combining <strong>logic</strong>, <strong>simulation</strong>, and <strong>interaction</strong>
      to study how intelligent systems reason in complex environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a PhD student within the <strong>National PhD in AI - Agrifood & Environment</strong> at the <strong>University of Naples Federico II</strong>.
      I work at the intersection of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, <strong>formal methods</strong>, and <strong>digital twin technologies</strong>,
      aiming to build AI that is both capable and explainable.

    <h3>Current Research</h3>
    <p>
      I contribute to the European project <strong>INFANT</strong>, developing intelligent and adaptive frameworks for pediatric healthcare and education.
      I design <strong>interactive simulations</strong> and <strong>reasoning modules</strong> that model adaptive behavior and social interaction,
      combining <em>temporal logics</em> with data-driven learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also developing an AI for <strong>videogames</strong> that uses <em>temporal logic</em> to reason about time, goals, and strategy,
      giving agents more realistic behavior in dynamic scenarios.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="callout">
      ‚ÄúNot just smarter AI, but AI you can understand and work with.‚Äù
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      My broader research lines, including <em>neurosymbolic AI</em>, <em>digital twins</em>, and <em>formal reasoning</em>,
      are outlined on the <a href="research.html">Research page</a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Broader Perspective -->
  <section class="card soft">
    <h3>Beyond Research</h3>
    <p>
      I care about clear ideas and useful tools. Outside the lab, I build small prototypes and game environments to test how
      <strong>formal reasoning</strong> can make AI more expressive and fun to interact with.
      I see creativity as a practical part of good research, it keeps logic grounded in experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I regularly join conferences and workshops (e.g., <strong>AAMAS</strong>, <strong>EUMAS</strong>) on multi-agent systems, human-AI interaction,
      and logic-based AI, which continuously shape how I approach transparent, human-aligned intelligent systems.
