  <section class="card">
    <p>
      I am a PhD student within the <strong>National PhD in Artificial Intelligence â€“ Agrifood and Environment</strong> program at the <strong>University of Naples Federico II</strong>. 
      My research lies at the intersection of <strong>artificial intelligence, formal methods, and digital twin technologies</strong>, 
      with a particular focus on how intelligent systems can model, interpret, and optimize complex physical and social environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      My current work contributes to the European project <strong>INFANT</strong>, which investigates advanced AI and IoT-based frameworks for supporting 
      child development and social inclusion through interactive and adaptive environments. Within this project, I have been involved in 
      the design of intelligent simulations and reasoning modules for educational and assistive applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2025, I attended the <strong>AAMAS Conference</strong> and related seminars, deepening my understanding of multi-agent systems, 
      computational logic, and humanâ€“AI interaction. My academic journey is also enriched by collaborations with interdisciplinary teams 
      combining <em>symbolic reasoning</em>, <em>machine learning</em>, and <em>interactive technologies</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond my doctoral research, I am passionate about science communication, open-source development, and the role of AI in addressing 
      societal and environmental challenges. I believe that bridging theoretical AI models with practical, human-centered applications 
      is key to the next generation of intelligent systems.
