  <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am a <strong>PhD student in Artificial Intelligence</strong> within the 
    <strong>National PhD in AI â€“ Agrifood and Environment area</strong> at the 
    <a href="https://www.unina.it/">University of Naples Federico II</a>.  
    My work moves across <strong>artificial intelligence, formal reasoning, and simulation-based systems</strong>, 
    with a particular interest in <strong>neurosymbolic models</strong> that integrate logical reasoning with deep learning.  
    I enjoy exploring how machines can <em>reason, adapt, and explain</em> their behavior in complex, interactive environments.
  </p>

  <h3>Academic Background</h3>
  <p>
    I completed my studies in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> at the University of Naples Federico II, where I first approached 
    the world of <em>computational logic</em>, <em>agent systems</em>, and <em>intelligent simulations</em>.  
    Over time, I became increasingly fascinated by the idea of combining <strong>formal logics</strong> with <strong>machine learning</strong> 
    to create systems capable not only of making predictions, but also of <strong>explaining and justifying</strong> their choices.  
    This interest naturally evolved into the field of <strong>neurosymbolic AI</strong>, which now forms the backbone of my research.

  <h3>Affiliations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Department:</strong> DIETI â€“ Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e delle Tecnologie dell'Informazione</li>
    <li><strong>Research Group:</strong> <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/astrea-naples/home?authuser=0">Astrea Lab</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Research & Projects</h3>
  <p>
    I currently work within the European project <strong>INFANT</strong>, which aims to build an integrated 
    <strong>pediatric oncology network in Campania</strong> through the development of intelligent digital infrastructures 
    and decision-support systems.  
    My role focuses on the <strong>design of interactive simulations and reasoning modules</strong> to model adaptive behaviors and clinical pathways, 
    leveraging <em>temporal logics (ATL/CTL)</em> and symbolic representations integrated with data-driven models.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond INFANT, I have been involved in the design of <strong>digital twin architectures</strong> for research and education, 
    and in the development of <strong>AI-driven simulations in Unreal Engine</strong> â€” environments that merge 
    <strong>formal verification</strong> and <strong>strategic reasoning</strong> to study agent behavior in dynamic contexts.  
    Much of my work revolves around the question of how to make AI systems both <strong>interpretable and interactive</strong>, 
    allowing humans to understand and influence the reasoning process behind complex decisions.
  </p>

  <h3>Academic Activities</h3>
  <p>
    My academic path has been deeply shaped by the interaction with the AI research community.  
    Over the years, I have taken part in seminars, demo sessions, and interdisciplinary workshops, 
    presenting my work and exchanging ideas with researchers from different backgrounds.  
    These experiences have strengthened my vision of AI as a discipline that blends <strong>mathematical precision</strong> 
    with <strong>creative problem-solving</strong>, where logic, simulation, and human-centered design coexist.  
    I am especially passionate about fostering dialogue between <strong>symbolic reasoning</strong> and 
    <strong>machine learning</strong>, aiming to develop technologies that are not only powerful, but also 
    <strong>transparent, inclusive, and aligned with human understanding</strong>.
